Linux Kernel Practice
============================

This Kernel Source is intended for use during Linux Kernel practice, and the kernel version being used is 6.9.7.

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can be rendered in various formats, such as HTML and PDF. Please read `Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst` first.

To build the documentation, use `make htmldocs` or `make pdfdocs`. The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the `Documentation/` subdirectory, several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the `Documentation/process/changes.rst` file, as it contains the requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about the problems that may result from upgrading your kernel.
